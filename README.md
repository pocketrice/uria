>  A URI may be represented in a variety
   of ways; e.g., ink on paper, pixels on a screen, or a sequence of
   character encoding octets.  The interpretation of a URI depends only
   on the characters used and not on how those characters are
   represented in a network protocol.
> 
> ...what is being identified is not some specific result that was
   obtained in the past, but rather some characteristic that is expected
   to be true for future results.  In such cases, the resource referred
   to by the URI is actually a sameness of characteristics as observed
   over time, perhaps elucidated by additional comments or assertions
   made by the resource provider.

A tiny digital media studies and linguistics project in experimenting with novel approaches to digital-augmented and digital-native requisition/transmission/representation of information. Designed in two phases; first is a typical URI workspace and second is R&D of a working novel concept.

This is predicated on the concept of designing an approach that is:
- grounded enough to interface reasonably well with existing digital (and possibly physical) devices <sub>◀ **basis on the URI standard should assure this!**</sub>
- radical enough to offer meaningful extensibility and redefine our relationship with information <sub>◀ **the humanities component should assure this!**</sub>
- personally offer a valuable wide-encompassing breadth of knowledge <sub>**◀ quite literally all aspects of this project!**</sub>
