<h4><em>"URI All-In-One" today, "URI Reductionist Intermediating Auxiliary" tomorrow</em></h4>

A tiny digital media studies and linguistics project in experimenting with novel approaches to digital-augmented and digital-native requisition/transmission/representation of information. Designed in two phases; first is a typical URI workspace and second is R&D of a working novel concept.

This is predicated on the concept of designing an approach that is:
- grounded enough to interface reasonably well with existing digital (and possibly physical) devices <sub>◀ **basis on the URI standard should assure this!**</sub>
- radical enough to offer meaningful extensibility and redefine our relationship with information <sub>◀ **the humanities component should assure this!**</sub>
- personally offer a valuable wide-encompassing breadth of knowledge <sub>**◀ quite literally all aspects of this project!**</sub>
